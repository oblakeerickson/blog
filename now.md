Here is what I'm currently up to:

It's winter so when I'm not working I'm up in the mountains
skiing with my wife and 2 kiddos.

As a snowboarder I'm learning how to ski this year. The first two days went just okay.
The third day I rocked it and could finally ski the green and blue runs with confidence.
Jury is still out if I'll stick to skiing or go back to snowboarding, but I'm enjoying
pushing myself learning a new skill.

We just got the Rogue Echo Rower which has been a great addition to our home gym
and a great way to get my heart rate up.
