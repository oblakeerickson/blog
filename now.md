Here is what I'm currently up to:

It's Winter so when I'm not working I'll probably be up in the mountains
snowboarding with my Wife and 2 kiddos.

As a break from my keyboard I'm really enjoying group workout
classes like BodyPump, Yoga, and Pure Barre!

For deliberate practice I'm working on mastering Ember.

I'm also trying out using Discourse as a Blog at https://blake.app, so
everything here might move over soon.
