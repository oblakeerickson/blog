Here is what I'm currently up to:

 - Going to the gym most weekdays (I'm also taking a yoga class a couple times a
   week!)
 - Eating less carbs and trying to not eat late at night
 - Finding time for deliberate practice
 - Building a new house which we hopefully can move into in a couple of months
