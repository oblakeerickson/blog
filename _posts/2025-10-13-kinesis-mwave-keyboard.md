No doubt inspired by [The Primeagen #461 Lex Fridman podcast episode][1], but not wanting to commit hundreds of dollars (just yet) I settled on getting the [mWave for Mac Mechanical Keyboard from Kinesis][2] as it was only $119.95 instead of $300+. 

I wanted one because I could tell how wonky I had to hold my wrists to type. While I don't think I have any wrist issues yet that I'm aware of I wanted to prevent any future issues and get something way more ergonomic. 

When I first got it the biggest issues was the 'b' key. Apparently I used to type the 'b' key with my right hand. The 'b' key though is on the left side of the split keyboard. To make it even worse though the 'n' key on the right side is extra long so I'm still pressing a key, I just don't always it isn't the 'b' key. After a week though I appear to be adapting quite nicely though to that change.

Using a regular keyboard no longer feels as comfortable now. So ya it might be really hard to ever go back now. I'm sure my future only has more even more extreme split layouts. It's only going to get worse from here on out. I do like this keyboard though, and hopefully I stick with it for quite some time. 

One thing I think I would like is blue switches that are a little bit more tactile, but these browns are probably more appropriate for an office environment. I work from home though and I want maximum loudness.

If you haven't tried out a split keyboard before I strongly encourage it. Your wrists will thank you.
