Tonight at #bruby [@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine) talked about using [Decorateors on Rails](http://johnotander.com/decorators_on_rails/#/).

Besides just hearing about the decorator pattern in a couple of things that I had read I didn't know much about using decorators. John gave a great introduction to the subject and I can't wait to start cleaning up some of my models and views.
