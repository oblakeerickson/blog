I really like personal blogs. They have personality. We should all visit them more.

Yes, I'm building an [RSS reader][0]. Not so that I can avoid looking at websites, but so that I can visit them more! Be sure to click through and visit the source. They really are modern art and way more fun to visit than just a social media feed.

- [birchtree][1] - Love the sidebar, has a link feed, and even gated member content.
- [Jake Goldsborough][2] - Jake is one of my new co-works at Discourse! Love the theme.
- [Dave Rupert][3] - Unique design and even has a Bookshelf to peruse.
- [Mike Perham][4] - Simple with a long history. I like how he's using a personal blog still for such a successful project like Sidekiq.
- [Lee Robinson][5] - So clean. Even has some subtle stats.
