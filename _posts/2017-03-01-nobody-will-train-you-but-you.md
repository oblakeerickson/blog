I first watched this video by [Zach Briggs](https://twitter.com/TheOtherZach)
originally back in 2013 when it came out and so I thought I would share it here
since it randomly came back to my rememberence the other day as I was probably
feeling overwhelemed with all the things I need to learn right now.

I'm not sure if his "Note Card" technique will work, but I'm going to give it a
fair shot and see how I'm feeling about my growth as a programmer in the next
few weeks/months.
