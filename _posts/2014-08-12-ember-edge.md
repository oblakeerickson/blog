I purchased [Developing an Ember.js Edge](http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Ember-js-Edge-Jamie-White-ebook/dp/B00JETLW32) a couple of days ago. I have not finished the book yet, but just starting working through the sample application.

The book is out of date, and the example application hasn't been updated in 9 months, but I still think there are some things you can take away from the book to help you improve as an ember.js developer.

Here is a [review](http://jaketrent.com/post/developing-an-ember-edge-review/) of the book from back in January.

I'm probably going to re-write their sample ticket tracking app using ember-cli. I'll keep you updated on my progress.
