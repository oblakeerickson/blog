I built [DailyWeight](http://dailyweight.herokuapp.com) about 5 months ago and then never touched the code or even logged into the app since then. I mainly built it just to learn some new things about Rails, and once I had the minimal viable product done I dind't see a need to work on it any more.

That's pretty much the approach I've taken for a couple of years now with all the new apps I've made. I create something to learn something new, and then I abandon the project as soon as I've mastered the new skill I was seeking.

I've been inspired by [Lee Munroe](http://www.leemunroe.com/) and his ability to ship great looking products that users actually want to use with [Flask](http://flask.io/) and [CodeShare](http://codeshare.io/).

My goal for DailyWeight and a couple other apps that I've created is to continue to polish them and get them out of their raw state and into a finished product that people will actually want to use (I actually want to use them too).

I think the easy part is building the prototype, the hard part comes in polishing the app day in a day out even after the initial excitement has left. With software there is no finished product, the finished product actually becomes the small iterations you make on a weekly/monthly basis. No one wants to use an abandoned piece of software that has no support, bug fixes, and new features. Users want to know that your app is living.
