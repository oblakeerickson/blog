Today I learned that you can embed Discourse into your static site (including Jekyll) so that you can use it as a blog engine instead of disqus which I've never been that excited about.

[Evil Trout](http://eviltrout.com/2014/01/22/embedding-discourse.html) has a great post about how to do this and it looks pretty strait forward. You pretty much just need to copy and paste some code inside of your layout file, but today I started working on a Jekyll plugin that you can use to make things even easier. Hopefully I can get that finished soon and out to the world.
