Searching the internet for tutorials that involve both Rails and Ember has proved quite difficult for me. I have found lots of tutorials that have been out date or that just were hard to follow, but I finally found the one I have been searching for so I thought I would share it with you.

It's a 4 part series by [Jason Kriss](https://twitter.com/jasonkriss) that walks you through using the Rails-API gem for the backend and how to use Ember App Kit on the front end. So, if you are interested in how to build Rails backed Ember apps check out parts [one](http://blog.jasonkriss.com/building-an-app-with-ember-app-kit-part-1/), [two](http://blog.jasonkriss.com/building-an-app-with-ember-app-kit-part-2/), [three](http://blog.jasonkriss.com/building-an-app-with-ember-app-kit-part-3/), and [four](http://blog.jasonkriss.com/building-an-app-with-ember-app-kit-part-4/).
