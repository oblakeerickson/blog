While I was checking my podcast app (can't wait for [overcast](https://overcast.fm/) by the way) for new episodes to listen to before I started mowing the lawn I was super excited to see that [Aaron Patterson](https://twitter.com/tenderlove) was on the latest Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots Podcast.

Aaron talks about how he got started with Ruby and [Adequate Record](http://tenderlovemaking.com/2014/02/19/adequaterecord-pro-like-activerecord.html#). You should definitely have a [listen](http://podcasts.thoughtbot.com/giantrobots/100).
