I've been trying to find a way to contribute to [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) and while I would still like to contribute to [discourse/discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) I have found a good opportunity with their [discourse/discourse_api](https://github.com/discourse/discourse_api) gem.

First of all I love API's and I've had a lot of fun playing with the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) when I built [longeststreak.net](http://longeststreak.net/). While I don't have a lot of experience building API's I do know how to consume them and want to make consuming the Discourse API as pain free and enjoyable as possible.

Second of all I think all the core contributors have been busy launching [Discourse 1.0](http://blog.discourse.org/2014/08/introducing-discourse-1-0/) that the discourse_api has been a bit neglected. There are many missing tests and a lot of features that need to be implemented. That should keep me busy for awhile and hopefully as I work on the discourse_api I'll eventually be able to make some contributions to discourse/discourse.
