Since I started working with Ember I've been writing a lot of ES6 JavaScript. I just happend to fall right into it working through tutorials and such, but I found [this post](http://andycrum.com/2014/06/29/a-quick-introduction-to-es6-modules/) today and thought it was a really good introduction to ES6 modules for anyone interested.

Also if you'd like to practice writing ES6 JavaScript I recommend working through the [JavaScript Exercism.io](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-javascript.html) exercises. I haven't worked on it as much as I would have liked to, but hopefully I can find some time to work through more of them.
