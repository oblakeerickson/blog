If there is one constant in my programming career it is that I always need to
be learning. The next new thing I'm learning about is Terraform. I'm actually
really excited to be learning about it because as you can tell from my previous
posts I've been learning about Puppet, but that is only for provisioning
servers that already exist and not for setting up new servers like Terraform
does.

Here are a few resources to get you started using Terraform:

- [The Terraform home page][1]
- [How to install Terraform on Ubuntu][2]
- [Why we use terraform and not chef puppet ansible saltstack or cloudformation][3]
- [Terraform Up and Running Book][4] (I just ordered this book, so I'm sure I'll let you know how I like it)
