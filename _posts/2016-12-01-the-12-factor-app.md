I probably should have started this on day one, but I just setup environment
variables for my node app [SkillSift](https://www.skilsift.com) using the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
package. And the readme for that package links to [The Twelve-Factor
App](https://12factor.net/), which I've never heard of before even though I'm
aware of most of the principles they talk about. If you build web apps you
should definitley check it out.

Here are The Twelve Factors that they talk about:

1. Codebase
2. Dependencies
3. Config
4. Backing services
5. Build, release, run
6. Processes
7. Port binding
8. Concurrency
9. Disposability
10. Dev/prod parity
11. Logs
12. Admin processes
