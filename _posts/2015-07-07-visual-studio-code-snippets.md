Today I learned that Visual Studio has a nice little feature called Code
Snippets which will insert blocks of code like if statements, class
constructors, try-catch blocks, foreach loops, etc.

There are many different ways that you can access code snippets so that you can
use them such as right-clicking where you want to insert code and selecting
'Insert Snippet...' from the dropdown. You can also you a keyboard shortcut
`Ctrl+K`, `Ctrl+X` to access the same menu. My favoriate way though is to start
typing the name of the actual snippet and then press `tab` `tab` and it will
auto insert the snippet.

Here is a quick example on how to insert a code snippet. Make sure your cursor
is where you want the code to be inserted inside of the Visual Studio editor and
type `cw` then press the `tab` key twice and it will insert:

```
Console.Writeline();
```

and place the cursor write inside of the `()` so that you can continue typing
what you want to print to the console.

I think these Code Snippets are really handy and can increase your
development speed and happiness.
