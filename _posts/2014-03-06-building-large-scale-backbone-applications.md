Brian Mann gave a great talk at the 2013 Backbone conference titled "The tools and patterns for building large-scale Backbone applications". Brian really sums up what is necessary to get over that hurdle from building small Backbone applications (like to do apps) to actually building full featured desktop like applications in Javascript using Backbone. It's definitely worth a watch. Also, can't wait for the 2014 Backbone conference!
