If you haven't caught on from my previos blog posts:

http://blakeerickson.com/2014/08/25/discourse-blog-comments/
1. [Learning Backbone.js](http://blakeerickson.com/2014/03/04/learning-backbonejs)
2. [Building Large-Scale Backbone Applications](http://blakeerickson.com/2014/03/06/building-large-scale-backbone-applications)

I'm teaching myself Backbone.

Today I finished my first Backbone application with a Rails backend. It's based off of the initial [Rails Tutorial Blog](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) and I had some help from this [tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

Feel free to checkout the [source](https://github.com/oblakeerickson/rails-backbone-blog) and that actual [app](http://murmuring-eyrie-2235.herokuapp.com/).

Now it's time to work on my next app that's going to use [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/).
