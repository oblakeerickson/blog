title: "Weekly Update #10 - Rise Up"

This is the start of a new year and one of my goals was to keep up with these
weekly updates and I decided that the best time for me to write these is every
Monday night and even though it is now 10 pm and I'm really tired I'm going to
keep up with my goal especially since its the first day of the year and giving
up on a goal on the first day probably isn't the best thing to
do.

Even though this is the first day of the year and I do have several goals but I
feel like the most important thing isn't my goals but that I build habits
everyday and have [systems][systems] to achieve them. Hopefully in the upcoming
weeks I'll provide some progress updates and let you know how I'm doing.
