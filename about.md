I’m Blake Erickson. I live in Eagle, ID with my wife and two kiddos. We love skiing as a family and enjoying the outdoors near our home.

I’ve always been into computers and enjoyed playing on the various computers my dad had for his business at an early age.

My computer life really accelerated though when I built my first computer as a teenager and really learned how they worked from the inside out. With my own computer there weren't consequences of screwing up the family computer my parents used for their business. I started using Linux at this time as well as just playing around with Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

- In 2004 I got my CCNA certification and started working for a VoIP startup in Boise called XMT3. It was a great place to work while I was still in high school where I got to use my training from the past two years taking Cisco classes. I remember knocking out an important website for them just in time for some investor meeting.
- From 2005 - 2007 I served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Still one of the best experiences of my life serving others.
- In 2008 I started taking computer science classes at Boise State University and started working at Pinnpointe Consulting Group doing a little bit of everything computer wise and learned how to program there. Mostly doing Excel VBA macros to automate lots of manual work, but also learned Ruby (my favorite programming language) there and build my first Sinatra app.
- In 2012 I took job at Basic Engineering in Fruitland, ID mostly working on a PHP app  called BasicSafe, but also helped out with some PLC automation in some potato factories around Idaho.
- In 2014 I worked at Royal Jay in Boise, ID as a C# and Angular dev mostly working on an app called Kno2.
- In 2017 I landed my dream job working at Discourse as a Ruby on Rails and Ember JS developer! I was an early employee at Discourse, I believe officially #11, and I'm still there to this day. While I've worked on many different things I'm currently interested in the Subscriptions plugin and helping sites earn money from their supporters.
