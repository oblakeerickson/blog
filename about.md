Hi, I'm Blake Erickson!

That's a picture of me in my current home office trying to figure something out
for work.

I'm employee #11 at Discourse where I work on devopsie type stuff. I love all
things programming and improving my craft.

Most importantly though I'm a husband to a beautiful red head and a father to
two cute kiddos.

While I am a little bit obsessed with computers my family really does come first
since life would be pretty meaningless without them. We like to do lots of
things together as a family like mountain biking in the summer and skiing (I
snowboard) in the winter. We also all like to play Minecraft together.

Currenly I'm playing in a co-ed soccer league where we have games every Monday
night. I haven't played soccer any many many years and it had been really fun to
get back into it and away from my desk.

Growing up my bedroom looked something like:

While I currently don't have that many computers in my home, I hope that I can
slowly work up a vintage collection like [this](https://blog.pizzabox.computer/).

Thank you for stopping by and reading my blog!

-Blake
